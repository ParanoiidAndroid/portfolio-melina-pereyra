  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": {
      "question": "How long does it take to translate a text?",
      "answer": "Translation time depends on several factors such as text length, content complexity, and translation type. For standard texts, I estimate approximately 2,000-2,500 words per business day. For sworn translations or specialized technical texts, the time may be longer. I will always provide you with an estimated delivery date when you send me the project."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "What file format should I send for translation?",
      "answer": "I accept files in multiple formats: Word (.docx, .doc), PDF, PowerPoint (.pptx), Excel (.xlsx), and plain text files (.txt). I also work with subtitle files (.srt, .vtt) and localization formats. If you have a specific format I didn't mention, consult me and I'll see if I can work with it. The important thing is that you send me the most editable file possible to ensure the best quality."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What are sworn translations?",
      "answer": "Sworn translations are official translations that have legal and administrative validity. They are certified by a public translator (like me) and bear my seal, signature, and registration number. These translations are required for official documents such as university degrees, birth certificates, legal documents, contracts, etc. that need to be presented to official agencies, universities, or for immigration procedures."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Can I see some of your translations?",
      "answer": "For confidentiality reasons and non-disclosure agreements with my clients, I cannot share complete translations of previous projects. However, I can provide you with translation samples of public texts or create a specific sample of the type of content you need translated. I can also share testimonials from satisfied clients who attest to the quality of my work."
